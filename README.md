ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Krishna. I work as a Software Engineer at devolo AG, Germany. I specialize in programming, mostly on the web and iOS, and have expertise in UX and data analysis. 

On a typical workday, you can find me finding ways to optimize tools we use at devolo and learning new technologies. 

Please contact me at Krishna.Subramanian@devolo.de.
